Crowdfunding Decentralized Application (Dapp)
Overview
This project is a Crowdfunding Decentralized Application (Dapp) built on the Ethereum blockchain. The application allows users to create and contribute to crowdfunding campaigns in a decentralized, secure, and transparent manner. The front-end is built using React, while Solidity is used for creating smart contracts to handle the core functionalities of the Dapp.

Features
Create Campaigns: Users can create crowdfunding campaigns with a goal amount and duration.
Contribute to Campaigns: Anyone can contribute to the campaigns using their Ethereum wallets.
Track Campaign Progress: Users can view the status of campaigns, including the total amount raised and time remaining.
Secure Transactions: All transactions between the front-end and Ethereum blockchain are securely handled using ethers.js.
Decentralized: No central authority; all campaign data and contributions are stored on the Ethereum blockchain.
Tech Stack
